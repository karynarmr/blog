<p>This is the third blog post!</p>


this is the day we started the exercises. 
i struggled with nesting divs, and the padding and margins were all wrong.  not to mention colors. 

**insert the images of the project in progress

<p>

The other thing I super struggled with was when i finished the first exercise and went to start the second.  To start, I copied the first in order to create the second.  i was just going to make some minor updates to the second rather than reinventing the wheel!  Brilliant!</p>
<p> Or so I thought. </p>
    <p>It took me over an hour to figure out i was still referencing the stylesheet from the first sxercise in the second HTML index file.  Can't really change the height and width of anything and see it push out if I'm referencing the wrong stylesheet.  Brilliant, indeed.
